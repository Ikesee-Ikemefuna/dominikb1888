# Artificial In Intelligence and the future ofmedicine(Healthcare from remoteness)

Artificial intelligence and remote health monitoring have extended their
innovative clinical practices by pushing the limiting barriers in healthcare
innovations and practices. Whether this will lead to long term clinical
outcomes and breakthroughs is still unknown but one thing is certain, the
advancements already present in healthcare through artificial intelligence
are a strong indication that medical AI is here to stay. Many tasks that
used to take a lot of resources and time in health centers and hospitals
are now automated with AI and done faster and with ease. In some health
institutions, it takes a great deal of time before a patient receives the care
they need because health providers have to manually access their medical
records, carry out series of tests, before putting them on long waiting lists
as many hospitals are short-staffed in some places. Artificial Intelligence
queues up the most relevant data from a patient’s hospital file, pull up
information and recordings of appointments and even their conversations
with the doctor down to the very specific ailment[1]. This saves health
providers and patients some valuable amount of time and might even
improve standard of healthcare in so many ways. Another way this might
improve healthcare and save time is, AI can predict which section of the
clinic that might be needing more staffing soon. This helps to decongest
crowd in hospitals mainly in this Covid era. Talking about Covid, the EU
funded AI project on Covid has made Lung damage through Corona Virus
very easy to diagnose, thereby expediting the whole process of its
treatment[2]; First, Artificial Intelligence software trades information with
hospital’s CT scanner. The Artificial Intelligence tool assesses the
tomography of the lungs taken by the computed tomography machine, it
identifies the signs of the disease and its extent of damage- all these
being done with swiftness and precision. Ordinarily, this process would
take an experienced Healthcare professional some time to carefully study
but the AI machine would require just a few seconds. Their speed and
accuracy stem from their deep learning algorithm, meaning that the more
work these AI machines do, the better they get at these diagnoses. This is
unlike humans who get fatigued with more work and eventually lose their
accuracy. It also reduces staff to patient contact thereby limiting the
number of hospital acquired Covid infections.
Apart from the way it limits new infection and facilitates medicare, its
innovative reach is unbridled. The implementation of machine learning in
surgery is one of such great leaps. Some Artificial Intelligence surgical
systems can carry out the finest of surgical movements with a hundred
percent accuracy[3]. This means complex surgeries could be carried out
with no risk of errors. Its precise procedure in turn enhances quick
recovery. Other AI medical innovations of the like are; the 3D printed
smart hand that was made to provide more artificial functionality to
prosthetic limbs. Another such innovation is the Automated Gait Analysis
that marks someones walking gait and makes diagnosis of an underlying
ailment. The Celebral Palsy Assistant and Autism Virtual Reality that
enables wearers of its VR headset experience what an autistic child goes

through everyday. As a matter of fact, the field of neuroscience has
benefited a great deal from the discipline of artificial intelligence. A lot of
researches, treatment and therapies are being carried out through AI,
including some breakthroughs in various fields of endocrinology, radiology
and oncology. It has facilitated early detection in many cases . Even some
diagnoses that require non-invasive approach have employed AI’s remote
approach in diverse ways. Due to these early detections, it reduces cost of
healthcare from consulting to diagnosis. For example, AI can alert us of
some biomarkers of some diseases in the body, thereby saving people
trips to the laboratory. AI assisted algorithms are thought to be more
cost-effective than other forms of medicine[3].
Its ability to see future with genetics and heredity is another magical
positive outcome. For example, a Google application called Verily is able
to forecast heredity and some genetic diseases[3]. This means people can
know ailments they are predisposed to through genetics and heredity and
apply measures to avert them.
### Limitations
However, Artificial Intelligence has its demerits and limitations. The
system is not completely error-proof. AI may miss a tumour or do a
double prescription of the same dosage which may lead to serious injury,
relapse and in worst cases death. Another problem with the AI system is
connected to privacy. A patient’s health records is a very sensitive part of
their therapy. Entrusting the handling of people’s medical records unto a
machine is a bit of a risk as they may malfunction at some point. This has
brought about some very tumultuous lawsuits in the past[4]. Thirdly,
nobody would want their healthcare completely delegated to a
machine[5]. The fear of being at the mercy of a mere machine is enough
turnoff to many. Furthermore, a lot of healthcare workers do not want to
lose their jobs to machines. Just as the camera-man feels threatened that
drone cameras might take his job, so does the surgeon fear that robotic
surgery machines might take theirs. Lastly, technophobic people would
not want to embrace these advancements made by Artificial intelligence in
Medicine no matter how helpful these breakthroughs are either because of
culture, beliefs or neo-luddism.
Although the AI medical system will eventually overcome its challenges,
like errors, doubts by patients and healthcare professionals[5], there will
never be a time Artificial Intelligence will completely take over the work
of health professionals. They just have to strike a balance between man
and machine while exploiting this very advantageous system.
Nevertheless, AI health system has come to stay. The way the world
around us is advancing technologically has made it impossible for Artificial
Intelligence health administered healthcare not to thrive. Although there
are still some luddites kicking against it on ethical and moral terms. It is
only a matter of time before antagonists give in to the next AI’s
outstanding innovation.
The future of Artificial Intelligence holds a great promise for the field of
medicine as new researches are ongoing about diagnosis and cure for

some diseases using AI. There is so much hope for the cure of Type 2
diabetes[6] and significant improvement in Radiology department in the
nearest future. Artificial intelligence is the new game changer in the field
of medicine and we all better embrace it.
